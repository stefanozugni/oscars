# Oscars Archive ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Angular-DD0031?style=flat&logo=angular&logoColor=white)

A simple Angular web app to browse all Academy Awards (Oscars) winners and nominations by year.

Instead of navigating through multiple Wikipedia pages, this tool lets you directly select a year and view all categories in one place ‚Äî winners and nominees included.  
It was born out of a personal need: I often watch a movie and wonder _‚ÄúDid this win any Oscars?‚Äù_  
Looking it up on Wikipedia usually means going through several links to find the right edition and then the right category. This app makes that process faster and more intuitive.
